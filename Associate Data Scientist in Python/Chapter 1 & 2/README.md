## [PROJECT] Invetigating Netflix Movies

In this project, I need to perform exploratory data analysis on the netflix_data.csv data to learn more about movies from the 1990s decade.

What was the most common movie duration in the 1990s? Store an approximate answer as an integer called duration (using 1990 as the start year of the decade).

A movie is considered short if it is less than 90 minutes. Count the number of short action movies released in the 1990s and save this integer as short_movie_count.
