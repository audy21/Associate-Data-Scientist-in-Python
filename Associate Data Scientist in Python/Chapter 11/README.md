## [PROJECT] Customer Analytics: Preparing Data for Modeling

In this project, I was trying to apply my knowledge of data types and categorical data to prepare a big dataset for modeling!

### Project Description

You've been hired by a major online data science training provider to store their data much more efficiently, so they can create a model that predicts if course enrollees are looking for a job. You'll convert data types, create ordered categories, and filter ordered categorical data so the data is ready for modeling.
