## [PROJECT] Visualizing the History of Nobel Prize Winners

Explore a dataset containing a century's worth of Nobel Laureates. Who won? Who got snubbed?

### Project Instructions

Analyze Nobel Prize winner data and identify patterns by answering the following questions:

What is the most commonly awarded gender and birth country?

Store your answers as string variables top_gender and top_country.

Which decade had the highest ratio of US-born Nobel Prize winners to total winners in all categories?

Store this as an integer called max_decade_usa.

Which decade and Nobel Prize category combination had the highest proportion of female laureates?

Store this as a dictionary called max_female_dict where the decade is the key and the category is the value. There should only be one key:value pair.

Who was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, and in what category?

Save your string answers as first_woman_name and first_woman_category.

Which individuals or organizations have won more than one Nobel Prize throughout the years?

Store the full names in a list named repeat_list.
