There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n\n# Start coding here...\n# Add as many cells as you like...\n\n# Performing Best Math Results\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools['average_math'] >= 640]\nbest_math_schools = best_math_schools[['school_name', 'average_math']].sort_values(by='average_math', ascending=False)\n\n# Performing Top 10 Performing Schools\nschools['total_SAT'] = schools['average_math'] + schools['average_reading'] + schools['average_writing']\ntop_10_schools = schools[['school_name', 'total_SAT']].sort_values(by='total_SAT', ascending=False).head(10)\n\n# Performing Largest Standard Deviation by Borough\nborough_stats = schools.groupby('borough').agg(\n    num_schools=('school_name', 'count'),\n    average_SAT=('total_SAT', 'mean'),\n    std_SAT=('total_SAT', 'std')\n)\n\nlargest_std_dev = borough_stats.sort_values(by='std_SAT', ascending=False).head(1).reset_index()\nlargest_std_dev = largest_std_dev.round(2)\n\n# Displaying the results\nbest_math_schools.head()\ntop_10_schools.head()\nlargest_std_dev","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":null,"executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":null,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":137,"type":"dataFrame"}},"lastExecutedByKernel":null,"visualizeDataframe":false,"chartConfig":{"bar":{"hasRoundedCorners":true,"stacked":false},"type":"bar","version":"v1"}},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"borough","type":"string"},{"name":"num_schools","type":"integer"},{"name":"average_SAT","type":"number"},{"name":"std_SAT","type":"number"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0],"borough":["Manhattan"],"num_schools":[89],"average_SAT":[1340.13],"std_SAT":[230.29]}},"total_rows":1,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"     borough  num_schools  average_SAT  std_SAT\n0  Manhattan           89      1340.13   230.29","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>borough</th>\n      <th>num_schools</th>\n      <th>average_SAT</th>\n      <th>std_SAT</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Manhattan</td>\n      <td>89</td>\n      <td>1340.13</td>\n      <td>230.29</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{},"execution_count":2}]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"editor":"DataLab"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
